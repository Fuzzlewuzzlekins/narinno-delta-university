    # Chapter 2: Mount Resshan
    # POV 1: Kim
    # [Background: view of a wild landscape, from a vantage point.]

    scene bg hiking with fade

    "If the neighborhood surrounding the NDU campus was impressive, then the temperate 
    rainforest that made up Resshan National Park was breathtaking."

    "Kim had vaguely known what went into terraforming the colonies, but seeing the results 
    in person was something else."

    "The native foliage and microfauna of Narinno Delta intertwined effortlessly with 
    assorted, carefully limited specimens from the Associated homeworlds."

    "Kim could only imagine how rigorously these nonnative introductions had to have been 
    modeled to ensure that the local life would continue to thrive."

    "She thought she spied the occasional Terran wildflower amidst the green sprawl, but 
    they blended in beautifully, one paint stroke in a thousand."

    "How far behind the pack she’d fallen by now to ogle the view was a mystery. Thankfully, 
    she had an excuse."

    vulnerability from a place of experience."
