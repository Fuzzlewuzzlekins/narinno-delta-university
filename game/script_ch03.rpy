    # POV 1: Kim

    scene bg school_exterior

    "Monday came and went in a whirlwind."

    "Each class was a new experience. A different room to find on campus, a different teacher to 
    meet, a different thematic energy."

    "Still, there was an undercurrent of commonality. This week was a week of firsts." 

    "Each class had to take its first session, either Monday or Tuesday, to lay down its 
    expectations, generally in the form of a printed handout."

    "Much of the process reminded her of high school, of course. The expectation of class 
    attendance and coursework was obvious, and each student she passed in the halls bore a 
    purpose in their stride."

    "And yet in other ways, the process hardly felt like high school at all."

    "Every building on campus was an art piece, boasting an extravagant entryway adorned by a 
    vaulted ceiling, or immense windows, or a sculpture."

    "The hallways were pristine, even luxuriously carpeted if you peeked down the ones where 
    professors’ offices were situated."

    "There were no lockers crowding the space, because they were unnecessary here, what with 
    students living on campus."

    "And that was the most jarring thought of all: {i}she could go home in the middle of the day.{/i}"

    "It was disorienting to have so much freedom. But convenient, she had to admit."

    "So that was what she was doing now, again, at 3 in the afternoon on Tuesday: walking back 
    to her dorm, again, because she wasn’t sure what to do with herself."

    "Of course, each time she did this, the route had been through a different section of campus, 
    which was fascinating in its own right."

    "Her current one took her through the plaza outside the science complex, on the north edge 
    of which was a little open-air café beneath a gazebo."

    "She hesitated. Perhaps she could spend the next half hour here with a cup of tea and a 
    snack, rather than returning “home” for a measly twenty minutes…"

    "???" "“Ah, excuse me! Kim?”"

    "Someone calling her name, however, was more pressing. She spun around in surprise."

    # [sprite: Karalún appears]

    "And there was the Jorgoan she’d met at orientation."

    ki "Oh, hey, Karalún! Good to see you again!"

    show kara grin with dissolve_f

    "The Jorgoan’s face brightened… into a toothy grin."

    "Kim flinched ever so slightly, but the lift of the cheeks did suggest a genuine smile, not 
    a threat."

    # [sprite: Kara puts a hand over her mouth.]
    # TODO: hands-over-mouth sprite for Kara

    ka worried talk "Ah! I’m sorry!"

    ka "I-I am still learning how to smile smaller. I don’t want to scare anyone."

    ki "Hey, hey, don’t overthink it! I’m getting used to it. Everyone else will too."

    ki "How’ve the first two days of class been treating you?"

    ka "Ah, well, thank you! My presence did not seem to anger anyone yet."

    ka "It is embarrassing that I still struggle with some written words in Standard. I have to 
    look them up later."

    ki "Oh, that’s normal. I don’t think Standard is anyone’s native language, everyone’s gonna 
    have to look up a word sooner or later."

    ki "...Actually, wait, I take that back. If it’s a creole language, that means it has 
    native speakers, right? Because if it didn’t, it would still be considered a pidgin."

    ka "I’m sorry, a what-language? And why is it a pigeon?"

    ki "Oh, sorry, let me back up."

    ki "When two unrelated languages come into contact with each other, and people have to 
    come up with a janky halfway point to communicate, that middle ground is called a pidgin 
    language."

    ki "Like, it’s a special lingo that people use to try to cross a language barrier."

    ki "But if the pidgin gets popular enough that people speak it all the time, instead of 
    just when they need it, to the point that their kids speak it as a first language, then it 
    officially isn’t a pidgin anymore. It’s a creole."

    ka "So… a pidgin language is a hybrid language that’s temporary, like a code, but a creole 
    language is what happens when a pidgin language gets big enough to have native speakers?"

    ki "Yep! I remember reading somewhere when I was a kid that Standard was a pidgin, but 
    much later I remember hearing it be called a creole, so it must’ve gotten promoted 
    sometime in the middle, after a census or something."

    # [background: changes to outside Takhu Hall]

    ka "Interesting! So it is young, then."

    ki "Yeah, the Association’s only a hundred and thirty-ish years old, so it couldn’t be any 
    older than that."

    ki "...What were we talking about? I have no idea how we got on this."

    ka "Oh, it’s fine. I just learned something, so that’s good!"

    ki "Heh, fair."

    "Come to think of it, she’d absentmindedly been walking towards Takhu Hall this whole time, 
    Karalún at her side. "

    ki "Ah, shoot… well, so much for that."

    ki "I was thinking about sitting down at that café back there."

    ka "Oh, I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to distract you. Should we go back?"

    ki "No, it’s fine! Not enough time at this point, and I was on the fence anyway."

    "Karalún blinked, perhaps in confusion at the phrase ‘on the fence,’ but if she had, she 
    chose not to ask about it."

    ka "Do you have something else scheduled soon?"

    ki "Yep, choir at 3:30. It’s the last class I haven’t seen yet."

    ka "‘Kwa-yur.’ You and Noah used that word a few times. It is… a type of music group?"

    ki "Yep, it’s for singing! That’s what you call a group of singers."

    ka "Ahh, that sounds like fun!"

    ki "Yeah, I’m looking forward to it."

    ki "Anyway, want to hang out in my room for a bit while we wait? It’s not much yet, but 
    it’s something."

    ka "Sure! I don’t mind."

    ki "Awesome. Maybe you’ll meet my roommate, I’m not sure if she’s in right now."

    ki "I’ll be sure to introduce you if she is."

    ka "Thank you! I’m happy to meet new people."

    # [background change: Kim’s dorm hallway]

    "Kim led the way inside and upstairs. It only took a minute to ascend to the correct floor 
    and arrive at Kim’s room."

    "She knocked on the door to alert her roommate of her presence. There was no response, so 
    after a few seconds she pressed her palm to the reader and slid the door open."

    # [background: Kim’s room.]

    "By this point, both beds looked well lived in. Kim felt a pang of sudden embarrassment at 
    showing Karalún such a messy space, but it was too late now."

    "To her surprise, however, the mass of blankets on the bed on the right shifted."

    # [Sprite: half-dressed Luziim appears]

    l "Hey. What time is it?"

    ki "Omigosh, I’m sorry! I-I’ll knock louder next time!"

    l "Nah, I heard you, I’m just lazy."

    # [Sprite: Luziim offers a hand.]

    l "Hey. Luziim."

    "Well, she seemed comfortable introducing herself as she was, which Kim supposed was fine."

    # [Sprite: Kara returns on screen, looking terrified. Music cuts out.]

    "Karalún, however… did not look fine. She stood frozen, eyes the widest Kim had yet seen 
    them."

    ki "Uh, Karalún? You alright?"

    # [Sprite: Kara’s gaze darts away.]

    ka "I am sorry. I should leave."

    l "What, am I that scary? I won’t bite."

    ka "Yes— ah! No! I—"

    ka "I-I-I do not want to disturb you. I will go now."

    l "You’re disturbing me by leaving me hanging here, girl. Name’s Luziim. What’s yours?"

    ka "K… Karalún."

    "She slid her hand into Luziim’s hand as if it were an animal’s jaws."

    ki "Okay, what’s going on here? Is there a problem I don’t know about?"

    "Karalún gaped at her."

    ka "I… I am Jorgoan, Kim! I—"

    l "And I’m a zanduul. What of it?"

    "That was when it clicked in Kim’s head. Or rather, thudded heavily into place."

    "Zanduul were an endangered species. And anyone with a middle school education or higher 
    knew why."

    # [Sad music comes in.]

    ka "Do you not… hate me?"

    l "No, why would I hate you?"

    ka "Because my people—"

    l "Your Empire committed genocide? I am well aware."

    l "And you’re not the Empire. You’re like, my age."

    ka "...I have been told that I am older than average—"

    l "Oh, stop. By what, a handful of years? Tell me how many years."

    ka "I am twenty-four of your years old."

    l "So you were twelve when the Searing happened. A twelve-year-old kid. My point still 
    stands."

    l "So, no, I don’t hate you. Because you’re not your parents’ generation, or whoever in the 
    Empire had their fingers on the controls."

    l "In fact, if you’re here, you hate the Empire too, right? You’re either Avikran or from 
    one of the rebel states."

    ka "Ah, yes. I am Avikran."

    # [sprite: Luziim smirks]

    l "Good. Then I think we can be the best of friends, Karalún."

    # [music: turns perky again]

    l "So what’d you do to piss them off? I must know."

    ki "Ah, that’s—"

    ka "I snuck into an archival building. Charged with breaking and entering, petty theft, and 
    treason."

    l "Oooh, you hurt ’em so bad you got treason? Hell yeah. We’re definitely friends."

    # [sprite: Karalún has finally begun smiling.]

    ka "Ha ha, if you like. I was part of a rebellion. We called ourselves the Destined Sun."

    ka "And I had a code name, Chasm-Darter. I was meant to be fast and… ah, sneaky? Sneaky, 
    yes."

    ki "Oh! That’s where you got your title from, at orientation!"

    ka "Yes! I am…"

    ka "Well, I… failed. And I am ashamed that I failed. But I am proud that I tried! So I 
    thought it made sense to be my orientation title."

    l "What’s this about orientation titles?"

    ki "Oh, we played a name game on Team Cobalt where everyone gave themselves a pretentious 
    title. Like ‘Lord of Candles’ and ‘The Dungeonmaster’ and stuff."

    ki "I called myself the Karaoke Queen because I like to sing, and so on."

    l "Aw, damn, you guys got the cool name game."

    l "On Team Chartreuse we just did animals. I was Luziim the Lizard. Yawn."

    ki "Hey, that’s not boring, it’s got a nice ring to it."

    l "Your sympathy is appreciated."

    "Kim chuckled. With an apparent lull in the conversation, she idly checked her wrist for 
    the time."

    ki "Oh, shoot! I’m almost late for choir."

    l "Ahh, of course, the Karaoke Queen is a choir kid! I should've gathered that."

    ki "Ha ha, yeah. I’m excited! It’ll be good to be in a group again."

    ka "I hope that you have fun! Perhaps after I learn how to read music, I will join you 
    next semester."

    ki "That would be neat! See you both later, then."

    "Luziim and Karalún both waved in farewell, and then Kim was on her way."

    # [background: dorm hallway again]

    "It was good to see Luziim and Karalún seeming to get along. After their awkward 
    introduction, Kim had been worried."

    "And goodness, how time could fly when one was chatting with friends! She hadn’t realized 
    it was nearly 3:30 already."

    "Thankfully she’d noticed early enough not to be running truly late. She had a good twelve 
    minutes to find her way to the music building, one of the last academic buildings on campus 
    she had yet to visit."

    # [background: choir hall]

    "The hallways in this building were comparatively tame, but the rehearsal spaces were grand 
    and vaulting. This choir room was no exception."

    "Risers formed an arc around one side of the room, upon which rows of chairs had been 
    crowded. Many students were seated already."

    "Were they supposed to find their own voice sections? Better to try than not, at least."

    "So she picked her way a few columns over, roughly to where she supposed the mezzo sopranos 
    should be."

    "There was a printed handout, just like all the others she’d received for her classes so far, 
    sitting on each unclaimed seat. She picked one up and settled into place."

    "It didn’t take much longer for the choir director to call everyone to settle down."

    "And then it was more of the same: a welcome to the class for the semester, and a 
    walkthrough of the printed handout."

    "Due to being a pass-fail activity course rather than a graded course, this printout was 
    shorter than most, which made sense. Kim dutifully skimmed along as the instructor walked 
    through it."

    "In between the key points of the syllabus, idle thoughts of Luziim and Karalùn filled in 
    the gaps."

    "Kim had known about the Searing of Anaziim for years. And yet she had failed to consider 
    its implications when interacting in person."

    "To think she could’ve caused an incident, if Luziim hadn’t been so friendly!"

    "She was so curious about the both of them now. Karalùn obviously had an unusual story, but 
    so did Luziim on the flipside. What had they both been through?"

    # [SFX: rustling of crowd moving]

    "Suddenly the other students around her were rising to her feet."

    "Oops, she must’ve missed the director’s call to rise so they could warm up."

    "But after she popped to her feet, she saw that the others weren’t standing at attention. 
    They were gathering their things."

    "Had the class been dismissed early?"

    "It was a baffling choice, and a disappointing one. She’d come here all excited to sing!"

    "Oh, well. She deflated a little as she stooped to gather her backpack, then joined the 
    throng filtering out the door."

    "???" "“Kim!”"

    "She froze."

    "She spun on her heel and scanned the crowd. Was someone calling her? She only knew a measly 
    handful of people on campus so far."

    "???" "“Kimiko-Who-Goes-By-Kim!”"

    # [Sprite: Nanneyo appears, waving and beaming.]

    "She honed in on the source of the voice."

    "Oh! This was the volunteer who had checked her in last week."

    # [Sprite: Blake and Fyorra appear as well.]

    "More specifically, she looked to be one of a trio of students who were currently clumped up 
    around the piano on the other side of the room."

    "Well, now that she’d made eye contact, she couldn’t exactly politely ignore the summons."

    "She trotted over."

    ki "Hey, hi! Didn’t think we’d run into each other again."

    "Former Volunteer" "“Small school, bound to happen eventually. I called it.”"

    ki "Ha, I guess you did! Sorry, your name was… Na-something?"

    nn "Ooh, good memory! It’s Nanneyo."

    # [Sprite: Nanneyo points upwards/outwards with two opposite fingers.]

    nn "And these are my besties, Fyorra and Blake."

    # [Sprite: Blake reaches forward]

    b "Kim, was it? Pleasure to meet you."

    f "Same."

    "Kim shook both their hands in turn. Fyorra’s scaly grip felt a little unsettling, but she 
    tried not to dwell on it."

    b "I don’t think I’ve seen your face around before. Are you an incoming freshman? If that’s 
    alright to ask."

    ki "Yeah, just started yesterday! This is the only class on my schedule I hadn’t seen yet."

    "She glanced towards the choir director."

    ki "Kind of, uh, surprised and disappointed we didn’t sing. I was looking forward to it."

    b "Yeah, Professor Achren has… days when he’s doing better than others, let’s say. We try to 
    be understanding when it happens."

    f "Poor guy’s too stubborn to retire."

    nn "(Hey, be nice within earshot.)"

    f "(Sorry.)"

    b "But hey, all that to say, we feel your pain! You showed up and just wanted to sing, 
    damnit!"

    b "Which is why we started using the tail end of class periods to stick around and work on 
    our own stuff. And you are welcome to join us."

    ki "Oh, I… you mean, right now?"

    "This was unexpected. Now that she’d mentally surrendered the class period, she had to take 
    a moment to recalibrate."

    f "Well, let’s not be too pushy with the recruitment, now. We’ve hardly even met."

    f "So, how do you and Nan know each other? I’m curious."

    ki "Oh, she helped me at check-in last week."

    nn "Yep! You were one of the S-names in my line."

    nn "I still think ‘Kim’ is super cute, by the way."

    ki "Oh, uh, thanks!"

    ki "It’s kind of an international shortening of my name, ha ha. It doesn’t work super well 
    natively. My mom thinks it sounds weird."

    ki "But my dad and my friends think it’s cute, so, I’ll call that a win?"

    nn "I’d call that a win!"

    b "I like it too. Though I have an Anglophone bias, so take that with a grain of salt."

    nn "Anyway, back to the earlier point. We definitely don’t want to bully you into anything, 
    but you’re totally invited to stick around with us after rehearsal whenever you want."

    ki "Oh, yeah, for sure! Sounds like a good idea. I’ve got no objections, not if it's within 
    the normal class time slot."

    ki "Do you normally just work on the choir pieces more, or do you do personal stuff?"

    b "Depends on how we feel. The former if we feel we need to figure something out, but the 
    personal pieces are more fun, y’know?"

    f "He says that because he likes to test his compositions on us."

    "Blake stiffened and tapped a folder under his arm."

    b "Hey, I think it’s fair to want to hear what I’ve written in actual voices in range. Try 
    singing these in my falsetto and see how you like it."

    "Nanneyo giggled at that."

    nn "Did you ever follow up on changing your emphasis, like you said? I remember you saying 
    you were considering switching from performance to composition."

    b "Ah, crap, not yet. Remind me to talk to Professor Achren next time he’s feeling better."

    ki "So you write your own music, then? That’s really cool!"

    b "Ah, thanks! I try, at least."

    b "These two keep insisting I take it professional, bank my music major on it. Not sure I’m 
    quite that cocky."

    nn "Aww, but you’re good!"

    b "Your praise is appreciated. I’ll take it into consideration."

    b "Hey, speaking of which, I’ve been working on some new stuff over summer break, if we all 
    want to take a look?"

    b "And hey, we can cover all four parts now! SATB!"

    b "Kim, soprano or alto?"

    "He’d already smoothly extracted a sheet from his folder and was handing it to her."

    ki "Oh, uh, mezzo soprano. Yeah, soprano’s fine."

    nn "I look forward to hearing your voice, Kim! I’m sure it’s lovely!"

    f "Let’s not put anyone on the spot, now."

    "After passing sheets to the two dubina, Blake slipped around to the other side of the piano 
    to take a seat."

    # [Sprite: Blake disappears.]

    nn "Oooh, I like this already.{nw=0.5}"
    extend " I think."

    f "You haven’t even heard it yet."

    nn "I’m trying to hear it in my head, hush."

    # [Sound: an arpeggio from the piano.]

    "Blake’s starting notes, however, interrupted that discussion."

    b "Alright, that’s our key, F major. Everyone got your notes?"

    "Nanneyo immediately smiled and hummed one of the notes from the chord."

    "Fyorra effortlessly chimed in on a lower note."

    "How in the world had they picked them out so fast…?"

    # [sound: a single note sounds a few times.]

    b "That’s you, Kim. You’ve got the melody."

    ki "Ohhh, boy…"

    nn "You got this! I believe in you!"

    ki "I don’t…"

    b "It’s okay if you haven’t done much sight reading before, it comes with practice. We’re 
    all chill here."

    b "Everyone ready?"

    nn "Yep!"

    f "Ready."

    "Kim gulped. This wasn’t a full choir, nor was it karaoke, nor singing in the shower. This 
    was a small group. Of strangers, no less."

    ki "Ready as I’ll ever be."

    b "Alright, on four."

    # be written. The more experienced three seem to be enjoying themselves. Kim looks with 
    # uncertainty at her music at one or two points, but eventually smiles, having fun.]

    "For as nervous as the poor newcomer had seemed, and as unhelpfully pushy as Blake and 
    Nanneyo had been, Fyorra had to admit: the girl had pipes."

    # [Sprite: Kim appears for the first time.]

    "Her posture was wary at first, but it didn’t take long to straighten with excitement."

    "She was apologetic when they took breaks, but was quick to correct her mistakes."

    "Her pitch was solid, and her timbre had a youthful brightness to it that Fyorra found oddly 
    fascinating."

    "Still, after they’d worked through a couple of pieces, Fyorra found emself checking eir 
    wrist for the time."

    "At 4:50 on the dot, ey cleared eir throat and raised eir hand."

    # [Sprite: the other two slide on screen.]

    f "Sorry, but I’ll need to call it here, friends. I have to be somewhere at five."

    "Blake checked his own wrist. "

    b "Ah, damn, I didn’t even realize we’d filled the class slot. Time flies when you’re having 
    fun!"

    ki "Oh, wow, we did run late."

    ki "Well, thanks for having me! I did have a lot of fun."

    # [Sprite: looks sideways at Kim.]
    nn "Oh, certainly! I did too."

    # [Sprite: looks back to the camera.]
    nn "Where’re you running off to? It’s late for most classes, isn’t it?"

    f "Math tutoring. First shift of the semester, I’d rather not be late."

    # [Sprite: Blake and Nanneyo both perk up. Especially Nanneyo.]

    b "Ah, cool, cool. You get on outta here, then."

    ki "Good to meet you, Fyorra!"

    f "You too, Kim. See you all Thursday."

    nn "Hey, wait—"

    # [Sprite: all 3 slide offscreen]

    "But Fyorra was already turning on eir heel to leave. Ey had ten minutes—nine now, 
    technically—to reach the third floor of the science complex."

    # [Background: a campus field, outside the music building]

    "Ey proceeded through the music building without event. But upon opening the exterior door, 
    ey heard a rapid gallop of footfalls approaching from behind."

    nn "Fyor! Wait up!"

    # [Sprite: Nanneyo reappears]

    # [AUTHOR’S NOTE: In an earlier version of the script, this is where the musical number 
    # “What Are Friends For” took place. Below I have rewritten the scene as prose as a backup 
    # (assuming musical numbers to be out of reach/a stretch goal), but the song may return in 
    # a later draft.] 

    nn "Yo, you can’t just casually drop ‘Hey, I landed a tutoring gig’ and not elaborate!"

    f "I didn’t think it noteworthy—"

    nn "Congratulations! That’s hella impressive!"

    f "...No, it really isn’t. The prerequisite’s only Calc 1."

    # [Sprite: cross.]
    nn "‘Only’ Calc 1? You say that like everyone and their nai can do it."

    nn "Learn to accept a little praise, yeah? We’re not all geniuses like you."

    f "I’m not a genius—"

    # [sprite: Nanneyo gets *very* close, with a blurry finger raised to the camera.]

    nn "Shh, nuh-uh-uh-uh."

    "Nanneyo’s finger was on Fyorra’s lips. Fyorra froze."

    nn "You’re skilled, Fyor. Take the compliment. It’s a life skill."

    "Fyorra didn’t move. The finger on eir lips was absolute."

    # [Sprite: she backs off, grinning]
    nn "Come on, let’s hear it."

    f "...Woo, I did a thing. Go me?"

    nn "Theeere ya go, that wasn’t so hard."

    f "Tch. I should be used to your ribbing by now."

    nn "Of course, that’s what best friends are for."

    A" warmth took hold in Fyorra’s cheeks."

    nn "What? You look surprised. Are we not best friends?"

    f "No, no, I feel like I knew that. But it feels nice to hear."

    "Nanneyo smiled again, more shyly than before."

    nn "I mean, it was inevitable, right? After being roommates for all of a year?"

    f "...No, I don’t think that’s standard, actually."

    nn "Oh."
    
    # [Sprite: she brightens mid-thought.]
    nn "Well, thanks for sticking with me, then. You didn’t have to put up with my bullshit."

    f "...Language, Nan."

    f "And no, I wasn’t going to just leave you to rot with that two-bottle hangover, I have a 
    heart."

    nn "You sure? Thought you were a prude. You could’ve left me to learn my lesson."

    f "I’m a prude, not a monster, sheesh."

    nn "Or you just love me."

    f "A’ight, if you’re gonna call me a prude, I’m gonna call you a shameless flirt, you 
    little—"

    nn "You’re cute when you’re riled up."

    f "Hey! No—!"

    nn "Cutie prude-y patootie."

    f "Cease!"

    "Ey couldn’t contain eir laughter anymore. Nanneyo had a way about her: always able to make 
    Fyorra crack. It was infuriating, in an inexplicably warm and fuzzy way."

    "The pair finally lurched to a stop. Apparently they’d been idly ambling to the science 
    complex this whole time."

    nn "Aww, I suppose I must take my leave, darling."

    f "Did you just walk me to work?"

    nn "Maybe."

    f "I missed the part where we got married."

    nn "We could do that, if you want."

    f "In your dreams, Nan."

    nn "Ouch! Right in the heart!"

    f "I’ll think about it."

    nn "Mm, better."

    f "See ya, Nan."

    nn "See ya, Fyor."

    # [Sprite: Nanneyo disappears.]

    "And that was that. Fyorra’s troublesome, bubbly former roommate parted with em at the door."

    # [Scene: the math lab.]

    "The math department was based on the third floor of the science complex. After ascending a 
    couple of flights of stairs, Fyorra beheld what had to be eir destination."

    "Just past the landing, the hallway gave way to a classroom-sized open space, populated 
    with a mix of desks and reading chairs. A sort of study lounge."

    # [Sprite: Prof. Banaru and Nyarokhu appear.]

    "Two figures were already present. Both looked idly in Fyorra’s direction at eir arrival."

    "The onka’s familiar face, at least, caused Fyorra to snap to attention."

    f "Ah, Professor! I’m not late, am I?"

    "Prof. Banaru" "“Oh, no, not at all. Glad you could make it.”"

    "Prof. Banaru" "“How was your summer break?”"

    f "Good, it was good! Nothing too profound, but it was nice to relax for a while."

    "Prof. Banaru" "“Glad to hear it.”"

    # [Sprite: Prof. Banaru raises a hand/looks around?]

    "Prof. Banaru" "“Now, have you two met? I’m not sure if you’ve had any classes together.”"

    "Fyorra looked the strange dubina up and down, who did the same in return."

    "Stranger" "“Don’t think so.”"

    f "No, can’t say I have."

    "Ey would have remembered that urban choice of attire, surely."

    "Prof. Banaru" "“Well, do take a moment to get to know each other. I’ll be right over in my 
    office if you need anything.”"

    "Prof. Banaru" "“Ah, and before I forget, these are for you.”"

    "Professor Banaru picked up a pair of small, elongated objects from the nearest desk and 
    handed one out to each of them."

    # [Art: “Math Tutor” placards.]

    "Fyorra inspected the item. It looked like a little paper tent, with “MATH TUTOR” printed 
    clearly on the sides."

    "Prof. Banaru" "“Keep those visible on your desks, wherever you decide to sit. That way 
    students will know you’re the ones to come to with questions."

    f "Seems simple enough."

    f "Any other procedures we should be aware of? Checking in and out, or…?"

    "Prof. Banaru" "“Oh, I trust that neither of you are the type to sneak out early. Unless I 
    should be concerned that you are?”"

    f "No, no! Wouldn’t dream of it."

    "Stranger" "“We’ll be good, Reiko. Promise.”"

    "Professor Banaru waggled a finger in the other dubina’s direction."

    "Prof. Banaru" "“I can never be too sure with you.”"

    "Prof. Banaru" "“I’ll get back to my lesson plans, then. You two play nice.”"

    # [Sprite: the professor leaves.]

    "And with that, they were away. Fyorra was alone with eir new coworker."

    "Well, they’d been invited to introduce themselves to each other, and it was proper form to 
    be acquainted with one’s colleagues, so…"

    f "Well, hey. I’m Fyorra. Was in Linear Algebra with Professor Banaru last semester."

    "The stranger took Fyorra’s proffered hand. The grip was warm, and slightly damp."

    "Stranger" "“Ah, that explains it. I just started Intro to Higher, we must be out of sync 
    on the core classes then.”"

    ny "Nyarokhu, sorry. Pleasure."

    f "It’s a pleasure, Nyarokhu."

    "Was it? Fyorra wasn’t sure how ey felt about shaking hands with such a shoddily dressed 
    individual, who yet claimed to be further than em on the core mathematics track."

    f "You’re on a first-name basis with Professor Banaru, then?"

    ny "With Reiko? They told my whole class to call them that. They’re chill."

    ny "I’m a little surprised you used their last name and title. Seems a little stuffy, yeah?"

    f "I’d rather err on the side of propriety, personally."

    "Nyarokhu didn’t say anything."

    "Fyorra cleared eir throat."

    f "So, Intro to Higher. You’re leaning more into theoretical math, then?"

    ny "As opposed to what?"

    f "Applied math. I’m starting Multivariate this term, and I’m already liking it better than 
    my last two classes."

    f "It feels intuitive, and more useful in practice, y’know?"

    "The corners of Nyarokhu’s mouth twitched downwards."

    ny "Do you think you’ll switch to an engineering degree? Do the half-and-half program?"

    f "The 3-2 program? Yeah, I’ve considered it. Not off the table."

    "Nyarokhu didn’t answer immediately."

    ny "Hm."

    f "...What’s ‘Hm’ supposed to—"

    # [Sprite: Nyarokhu looks off to the side]

    "Nyarokhu suddenly looked away, at the same moment Fyorra heard footsteps on the stairs."

    "Fyorra kept quiet and slipped towards a desk seat. It would not do for someone to walk by 
    and see the two of them squabbling."

    # [Sprite: Nyarokhu disappears.]

    "Ey set the “MATH TUTOR” placard down at the edge of the desk, took a moment to straighten 
    it, and then let eir bag hit the floor as ey settled onto a stool."

    "Out of the corner of eir eye, ey noticed a pair of figures emerging from the stairwell. 
    Two onkai."

    "They quietly took seats of their own. Aside from the noise of unzipping bags and rustling 
    papers, the lounge was still."

    "It was several minutes into the hour, and these were the only two visitors so far. Fyorra 
    idly wondered if attendance would remain this low all evening."

    "Oh well, there was nothing preventing em from working on eir own homework. Ey extracted a 
    book and binder from eir bag."

    "For time, all was quiet, save the occasional ambient sounds of papers turning and pencils 
    scribbling."

    "However, a whisper from one of the onkai in the corner eventually caught Fyorra’s 
    attention."

    "Student 1" "“(So do we just walk up to them?)”"

    "Student 2" "“(Yeah, the ones with the placards. No shame, that’s why we’re here.)”"

    "Student 1" "“(I know, it’s just…)”"

    "Student 2" "“(Just go up and ask him. He won’t bite.)”"

    # [Music: fades out.]

    "Fyorra looked up from eir work."

    "Who was this he/him they were referring to? Did they really just presume…?"

    "Ey turned in eir seat."

    # [Sprite: the pair of onkai appear.]

    f "Hey, excuse me."

    # [Sprite: they perk up, surprised.]

    "Student 2" "“Hm? Yeah?”"

    f "In case you weren’t aware, it’s generally considered rude to assume a binary pronoun for 
    us."

    "Student 2" "“What? I didn’t—”"

    # [Sprite: Nyarokhu appears.]

    ny "Fyorra, drop it. It’s fine."

    f "Fine? I was correcting an assumption. I’d want to be corrected if I—"

    ny "She didn’t assume, she knows me from last year. Now drop it."

    "Student 1" "“Did I do something wrong…?”"

    ny "No, neither of you did anything wrong. It’s fine."

    f "No, hold up, what am I missing here? Are we just going to let this slide?"

    # [Sprite: Nyarokhu scowls, his spurs extending. Sound: a faint shink as the music stops.]

    ny "..."

    # [sprite: Nyarokhu forces a smile, but his spurs are still out.]

    ny "Fyorra, can we step out for a sec?"

    "Nyarokhu’s spurs… a sure sign that Fyorra had touched a nerve."

    "Fyorra rose and approached, aware of a nervous lump in eir throat."

    ny "Excuse us."

    # [Sprite: the onkai slide offscreen. Background: switches to the stairwell.]

    "Leaving the students alone for a moment, they stepped several paces down the hallway and 
    turned into the stairwell."

    # [Sprite: Nyarokhu is suddenly close to the camera, furious.]

    ny "(What the fuck is your problem?!)"

    "Fyorra recoiled from the venom in Nyarokhu’s whisper."

    f "(My problem? I was standing up for you!)"

    ny "(You were sticking your nose in my own goddamn business!)"

    f "(You ungrateful little—)"

    "No, this hissing at each other was immature. Fyorra was better than this. Ey leaned back 
    and took a steadying breath."

    # [Sprite: Nyarokhu shrinks back to normal size.]

    f "Look, all I’m saying is that if you’d stood up to her misgendering me, I’d have been 
    grateful."

    ny "She didn’t misgender me. I use all pronouns."

    ny "Hell, I introduce myself as ‘he/him’ half the time because most of the topsies’ brains 
    explode if you don’t give ’em a preference."

    "Fyorra winced at the much less polite alternative to “bipeds,” but more worrisomely, this 
    was vital new information."

    f "I…"

    f "Wait, hang on. So you’re just playing their game, then?"

    f "‘Any pronouns’ is a legitimate answer, you shouldn’t stoop to their level."

    ny "..."

    ny "I am not stooping to anyone’s level. This is—"

    # [Sprite: Nyarokhu slumps.]

    ny "...This isn’t worth my time."

    ny "Truce. We both keep to ourselves and keep our mouths shut."

    # [Sprite: Nyarokhu slides away.]

    "Before Fyorra could retort, Nyarokhu had stalked back into the hallway with heavy strides."

    "Truce."

    "A truce ey could do, a pact to live and let live until this semester was over."

    "Ey followed Nyarokhu back to the lounge and resumed eir seat."

    "Still, ey glanced at the other dubina one last time."

    "Surely he knew he’d look a little more professional without the hat, right?"

    "Oh well. Not Fyorra’s problem."
